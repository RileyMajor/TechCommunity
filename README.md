# TechCommunity

Information about the technology community -- starting with lists of user groups and events.

Eventually, I'd like this to be an interactive database of user groups and technical events. For now, I'm just going to manually list those groups and events I'm aware of and have time to populate.

## User Groups

| Tech | ID  | Name | Twitter | URL |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- |
| MSSQL | PASSMN | PASSMN | @PASSMN | http://minnesota.sqlpass.org/ |
| PHP | MNPHP | Minnesota PHP User Group | @mnphp | http://www.meetup.com/mn-php/ |

## Events

Currently, this is more about conferences than user group meetings.

| Tech | ID  | Name | Group | Last Date | URL | 
| ---- | --- | ---- | ----- | --------- | --- | 
| MSSQL | SQLSatMN | SQL Saturday - MN | PASSMN | 2014-10-25 | https://www.sqlsaturday.com/332/eventhome.aspx |
| PHP | MidwestPHP | Midwest PHP | MNPHP | 2015-03-14 | http://2015.midwestphp.org/ |

##Notes

* The Group column under Events links to the Group ID of the organizing group.
