# TechCommunity

Information about the technology community -- starting with lists of user groups and events.

Eventually, I'd like this to be an interactive database of user groups and technical events. For now, I'm just going to manually list those groups and events I'm aware of and have time to populate.

To ensure the data is:

* fully public,
* easily consumed by machine, and
* able to by collaboratively edited by the community

I'm storing it in JSON form right on GitHub.

To ensure the data is easily consumed by humans, I've created a simple web page which gathers the data from the JSON files and displays them in tables. It's hosted using GitHub pages.

The official URL is:

[http://RileyMajor.github.io/TechCommunity/](http://RileyMajor.github.io/TechCommunity/)

However, it should also be accessible from:

[http://www.TechCommunity.rocks/](http://www.TechCommunity.rocks/)

Please contribute any information or any improvements to the simple rendering engine.
